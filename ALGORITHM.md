## [SearchAlgorithm](#searchalgorithm)

Sorting in nothing but arranging the data in ascending or desceding order.

### [BubbleSort](/Bubble%20Sort.py)

Bubble Sort is simple algorithm so **often** it's used to introduce the concept the sorting algorithm.
In Bubble sort techinque, Each pair of adjcent element is compared and elementn are swapped if they are not in order.

Time Complexity : O(n*n). Worst case when array is reverse sorted.

### [Insertion Sort](#insertion-sort)

Insertion Sort is easy to implement, but it's very slow on large array and is almost never used to sort them.
It's a table, in-place algorithm, that works really well for nearly-sorted or small array.
